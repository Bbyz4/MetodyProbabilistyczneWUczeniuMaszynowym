# MetodyProbabilistyczneWUczeniuMaszynowym

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects and a final project completed as part of the course **Probabilistic Methods in Machine Learning** at Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w.

Each project includes:
- üë®‚Äçüíª **Implementations of machine learning algorithms from scratch**
- üëÅÔ∏è **Visualizations (plots or gameplay videos)** showcasing results
- üìù **Reports** with detailed problem descriptions, algorithm explanations, and conclusions

All **mini-projects** were implemented in **Python**  

The **final project** was implemented in **C#**  

Reports were written in **LaTeX**

## Mini-project 1: Linear Regression
Implementation of **linear regression using both analytical and gradient-based methods**.  
Includes comparison of results obtained with different loss functions, basis functions, regularization methods, and scaling.

## Mini-project 2: Generative vs Discriminative Classifiers
Comparison of generative and discriminative classifiers for a **breast cancer detection task**.  
Implemented algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes

Includes analysis of their learning curves.

## Mini-project 3: Phishing Classification
Comparison of classification algorithms on a **phishing website detection dataset**.  
Implemented algorithms:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) with various kernels
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- AdaBoost with different weak classifiers

## Mini-project 4: Clustering
**Comparison of clustering algorithms** on multiple datasets, with a focus on 2D point-set visualization.  
Implemented algorithms:
- k-means / k-means++
- Hierarchical clustering
- Spectral clustering

## Final Project: 1vs1 Game Bot
This project was completed in collaboration with [my teammate](https://github.com/xAsylum).

We implemented a neural network able to play a simple **1vs1 competitive game** against hardcoded bots.  

Main tasks:
- Create a minimalistic 2-player environment independent of any engine
- Implement a neural network and reinforcement learning algorithms from scratch
- Develop a Unity-based environment for visualizing gameplay and enabling human play
- Compare effectiveness of different learning algorithms
- Write a comprehensive report

‚ö†Ô∏è This repository contains only the **raw ML/game logic**.  
The full Unity game is located in a separate repository.

## Zestawy (Problem Sets)
Contains written solutions to selected theoretical problems solved during the course.
